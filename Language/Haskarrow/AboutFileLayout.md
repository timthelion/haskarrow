Files that have functions that see unchecked user generated content and thus can return
 Either Error Result

Parser.lhs:
 Reads in the file as a list of [[Tok]] as lexed by the her-lexer package(written by Conor McBride for she).
 Produces a list of values and some processed source code.
 Detects syntax errors in the haskarrow source.

DependencyResolver.lhs:
 Sorts the [Value] in an order such that more depended upon values are resolved first.
 Detects the error of non existant dependencies.  Should also detect recursive dependencies(but doesn't)

The rest of the files should not have code that has to worry about errors in human generated input.  This code is therefore much simpler :)
 
CodeGeneratorConstants.lhs:
 Contains a lot of info on how the code should look after being generated.

CodeGenerator.lhs:
 From the list of [Value] provided by the parser, creates all autogenerated portions of the haskell source.

Types.lhs:
 Generic types used by all modules.
